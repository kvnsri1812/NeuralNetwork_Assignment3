1. How does NER differ from POS tagging in NLP?

NER (Named Entity Recognition) identifies specific named entities in a sentence—such as people, locations, dates, and organizations—and classifies them with predefined labels like PERSON, DATE, or GPE.

POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging, in contrast, labels each word based on its grammatical role, such as noun, verb, adjective, or preposition.

Example:
In the sentence "Barack Obama was the president."

POS Tagging: "Barack" → Proper Noun (NNP), "was" → Verb (VBD)

NER: "Barack Obama" → PERSON

Summary: POS tagging is about grammar, while NER is about real-world named entities.

2. Two Real-World Applications of NER

a) Financial News Analysis
NER helps extract company names, stock tickers, and financial figures from market news to support investment decisions and automate reports.

b) Search Engines and Assistants
Search systems use NER to understand user queries better by identifying names of people, cities, or brands—e.g., recognizing "Nobel Peace Prize 2009" as a key topic.

Summary: NER improves data organization, question answering, and decision-making by linking text to real-world entities.
